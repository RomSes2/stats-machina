StatsMachina is a third-party Google Sheets Add-on that allows users to calculate statistical measures for web experiments.

## What information do you collect?
When activating StatsMachina in a spreadsheet and using the added functions in a cell, we collect logs of the raw data provided. We use a minimal version of the Google Analytics Measurement Protocol to track data, to which we do not pass personal information. For example, we do not track IP address or User Agent. We only track when a function is used, its name, and when a sidebar is opened.

## How do you use the information?
This information is used for analytical and development purposes. Email addresses are used to verify usage quotas and prevent abuse to our servers.

## What information do you share?
We do not share any data.
